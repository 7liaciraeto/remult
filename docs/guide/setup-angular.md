# Todo App with Angular
### Build a production ready task list app with Remult using Angular + Node

In this tutorial we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use Angular for the UI, Node + Express for the API server, and Remult as our full stack framework. For deployment to production, we'll use Heroku and a PostgreSQL database. By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `TypeScript` and `Angular`.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. <!-- consider specifying Node minimum version with npm -->


## Create a Project
We'll start by creating an Angular project, so if Angular CLI is not already installed - then install it.
```sh
npm i -g @angular/cli
```
### Create an Angular Project
Create the new Angular project.
```sh
ng new remult-angular-todo
```
::: warning Note
The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.
:::

### Adding Remult and Server Stuff
In this tutorial we'll be using the workspace folder created by `Angular` as the root folder for our server project as well.
```sh
cd remult-angular-todo
```
#### Installing required packages
We need `express` to serve our app's API and, of course, `remult`.
```sh
npm i express @remult/core@next
npm i --save-dev @types/express
```
#### The API server project

The starter API server TypeScript project contains a single module which initializes `Express`, starts Remult and begins listening for API requests.

In our development environment we'll use [ts-node-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev) to run the API server.

1. Install `ts-node-dev`
   ```sh
   npm i ts-node-dev --save-dev
   ```

2. Open your IDE.

3. Create a `server` folder under the `src/` folder created by Angular.

4. Create an `index.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

   *src/server/index.ts*
   ```ts
   import * as express from 'express';
   import { initExpress } from '@remult/core/server';
   import '../app/app.module';

   let app = express();
   initExpress(app);
   app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
   ```

   ::: warning Note
   Remult creates RESTful API endpoints based on decorators in the application code. Importing the Angular `../app/app.module` in the main server module **ensures all the decorators used in our app are found by Remult**.

   Sure, this means the entire Angular app is loaded on the server-side, but that's a small price to pay for keeping our code simple.
   :::

5. In the root folder, create a TypeScript config file `tsconfig.server.json` for the server project.

   *tsconfig.server.json*
   ```json
   {
      "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
      "compilerOptions": {
         "outDir": "./dist/server",
         "module": "commonjs",
         "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
      },
      "include": [
         "src/server/*.ts"
      ]
   }
   ```

6. Create an `npm` script `dev-node` to start the dev API server, by adding the following entry to the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

   *package.json*
   ```json
   "dev-node": "ts-node-dev --project tsconfig.server.json src/server/"
   ```
   
7. Start the dev API server.

   ```sh
   npm run dev-node
   ```
ои
The server is now running and listening on port 3002. `ts-node-dev` is watching for file changes and will restart the server when code changes are saved.

### Finishing up the Starter Project

#### Proxy API requests from Webpack DevServer to Node and run the Angular app
The Angular app created in this tutorial is intended to be served from the same domain as its API. 
However, during development, the API server will be listening on `http://localhost:3002`, while the Angular app is served from `http://localhost:4200`. 

We'll use the [proxy](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) feature of webpack dev server to divert all calls for `http://localhost:4200/api` to our dev API server.

1. Create a file `proxy.conf.json` in the root folder, with the following contents:

   *proxy.conf.json*
   ```json
   {
      "/api": {
         "target": "http://localhost:3002",
         "secure": false
      }
   }
   ```

2. Create an `npm` script `dev-ng` to serve the Angular app with the `--proxy-config` option, by adding the following entry to the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

   *package.json*
   ```json
   "dev-ng": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --open"
   ```

   ::: warning Note
   The `start` and `build` npm scripts created by Angular CLI will be modified in the [Deployment](#deployment) section of this tutorial to script that will `start` and `build` the full-stack app.
   :::

3. Start the Angular app in a new terminal. **Don't stop the `dev-node` script. `dev-ng` and `dev-node` should be running concurrently.**

   ```sh
   npm run dev-ng
   ```

The default Angular app main screen should be displayed.

::: tip
If you are using Visual Studio Code and would like to run both `dev-node` and `dev-ng` scripts using a single Visual Studio Code `task`, create a `.vscode/tasks.json` file with the contents found [here](https://gist.github.com/noam-honig/623898a6cd539d86113263d3c63260f0) and run the `dev` task.
:::

#### Setting up an Angular DI Provider for Remult
Our Angular starter project is almost ready. All that's left is to add a dependency injection provider for the `Remult` `Context` object. The `Context` object provided will be used to communicate with the API server.

This requires making the following changes to `app.module.ts`:
1. Import Angular's [HttpClientModule](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClientModule)
2. Add an Angular `provider` for the `Context` object, which depends on Angular's `HttpClient` object

While we're editing the root Angular module, we can also import the `FormsModule` which we'll need later in order to use the [ngModel](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel) two-way binding directive.

*src/app/app.module.ts*
```ts{5-7,15-16,19}
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HttpClientModule, HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { Context } from '@remult/core';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: Context, useClass: Context, deps: [HttpClient] }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```


## Entities

Now that our starter project is ready, we can start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:
* As a model class for client-side code
* As a model class for server-side code
* By `remult` to generate API endpoints and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an `id` field and a `title` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

Create a file `task.ts` in the `src/app/` folder, with the following code:

*src/app/task.ts*
```ts
import { Field, Entity, IdEntity } from "@remult/core";

@Entity({
    key: "tasks",
    allowApiCrud: true
})
export class Task extends IdEntity {
    @Field()
    title: string;
}
```

The `@Entity` decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class, and accepts an argument which implements the `EntitySettings` interface. We use an anonymous object to instantiate it, setting the `key` property (used to name the API route and database collection/table), and the `allowApiCrud` property to `true`. <!-- consider linking to reference -->

`IdEntity` is a base class for entity classes, which defines a unique string identifier field named `id`. <!-- consider linking to reference -->

The `@Field` decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field. This decorator is also used to encapsulate field related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.


### Create new tasks

The first feature of our app is letting the user create a new task by typing a task title and clicking a button.

Let's implement this feature within the main `AppComponent` class.

1. Add the highlighted code lines to the `AppComponent` class file:

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts{2-3,12-18}
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';
   import { Context } from '@remult/core';
   import { Task } from './tasks';

   @Component({
      selector: 'app-root',
      templateUrl: './app.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
   })
   export class AppComponent {
      title = 'remult-angular-todo';
      constructor(public context: Context) { 
      }
      newTask = this.context.for(Task).create();
      async createNewTask() {
         await this.newTask.save();
         this.newTask = this.context.for(Task).create();
      }
   }
   ```

   The `context` field we've add to the `AppComponent` class (using a constructor argument), is a Remult `Context` object which will be instantiated by Angular's dependency injection. We've declared it as a `public` field so we can use it in the HTML template later on in the tutorial.

   The `newTask` field contains a new, empty, instance of a `Task` entity object, instantiated using Remult. 
   
   The `createNewTask` method stores the newly created `task` to the backend database (through an API `POST` endpoint handled by Remult), and the `newTask` member is replaced with a new `Task` object.

2. Replace the contents of `app.component.html` with the following HTML:

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html
   <title>{{title}}</title>
   <div>
      <input [(ngModel)]="newTask.title" placeholder="Title">
      <button (click)="createNewTask()">Create new task</button>
   </div>
   ```

   Using the `ngModel` directive, we've bound the `inputValue` property of the new task's `title` field to an `input` element.

   **The `inputValue` property is a `string` property which handles parsing and formatting of entity field values to and from valid `input` values.** This is less of an issue with `string` fields, but is valuable for `Number` or `Boolean` fields.

   For the `placeholder` of the `input` element, we've used the `caption` property of the the `title` field. The default value of the `caption` property is the name of entity class field (i.e. "Title").

### Run and create tasks
Using the browser, create a few new tasks. Then navigate to the `tasks` API route at <http://localhost:4200/api/tasks> to see the tasks have been successfully stored on the server.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
By default, `remult` stores entity data in a backend JSON database. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the workspace folder, with a `tasks.json` file that contains the created tasks.

If you're using git, it is advisable to exclude the `db` folder from version control by adding it to the project's `.gitignore` file.
:::


### Display the list of tasks
To display the list of existing tasks, we'll add a `Task` array field to the `AppComponent` class, load data from the server, and display it in an unordered list.

1. Add the following code to the `AppComponent` class:

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   tasks: Task[];
   async loadTasks() {
      this.tasks = await this.context.for(Task).find();
   }
   ngOnInit() {
      this.loadTasks();
   }
   ```
   The `ngOnInit` hook method loads an array of tasks when the component is loaded.

2. Add the unordered list element to the `app.component.html` file.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html
   <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
         {{task.title}}
      </li>
   </ul>
   ```

3. To refresh the list of tasks after a new task is created, add a `loadTasks` method call to the `createNewTask` method of the `AppComponent` class.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts{4}
   async createNewTask() {
      await this.newTask.save();
      this.newTask = this.context.for(Task).create();
      this.loadTasks();
   }
   ```

After the browser refreshes, the list of `tasks` appears. Create a new `task` and it's added to the list.

### Delete tasks
Let's add a `Delete` button next to each task on the list, which will delete that task in the backend database and refresh the list of tasks.

1. Add the following `deleteTask` method to the `AppComponent` class.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   async deleteTask(task: Task) {
     await task.delete();
     this.loadTasks();
   }
   ```

2. Add the `Delete` button to task list item element in `app.component.html`.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html{3}
   <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
      {{task.title.value}}
      <button (click)="deleteTask(task)">Delete</button>
   </li>
   ```

After the browser refreshes, a `Delete` button appears next to each task in the list. Delete a `task` by clicking the button.

### Making the task titles editable
To make the titles of the tasks in the list editable, let's add an html `input` for the titles, and s `Save` button to save the changes to the backend database. We'll use the `wasChanged` method of the entity class to disable the `Save` button while there are no changes to save.

Replace the task `title` template expression in `app.component.html` with the highlighted lines:

*src/app/app.component.html*
```html{2-3}
<li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
   <input [(ngModel)]="task.title">
   <button (click)="task.save()" [disabled]="!task.wasChanged()">Save</button>
   <button (click)="deleteTask(task)">Delete</button>
</li>
```

### Mark tasks as completed
Let's add a new feature - marking tasks in the todo list as completed using a `checkbox`. Titles of tasks marked as completed should have a `line-through` text decoration.

1. Add a `completed` field of type `boolean` to the `Task` entity class, and decorate it with the `@Field` decorator.

   *src/app/task.ts*
   ```ts
   @Field()
   completed: boolean;
   ```

2. Add a an html `input` of type `checkbox` to the task list item element in `app.component.html`, and bind its `ngmModel` to the `inputValue` property of the task's `completed` field. 
   
   Set the `text-decoration` style attribute expression of the task `title` input element to evaluate to `line-through` when the value of `completed` is `true`.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html{2-4}
   <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
     <input [(ngModel)]="task.completed" type="checkbox">
     <input [(ngModel)]="task.title" 
        [style.textDecoration]="task.completed?'line-through':''">
     <button (click)="task.save()" [disabled]="!task.wasChanged()">Save</button>
     <button (click)="deleteTask(task)">Delete</button>
   </li>
   ```

After the browser refreshes, a checkbox appears next to each task in the list. Mark a few tasks as completed using the checkboxes.

::: tip
To save the change of `task.completed` immediately when the user checks or unchecks the checkbox, simply add a `change` event handler to the checkbox element and call `task.save()`.
:::
### Code review
We've implemented the following features of the todo app:
* Creating new tasks
* Displaying the list of tasks
* Updating and deleting tasks
* Marking tasks as completed

Here are the code files we've modified to implement these features.

*src/app/task.ts*
```ts
import { Field, Entity, IdEntity } from "@remult/core";

@Entity({
    key: "tasks",
    allowApiCrud: true
})
export class Task extends IdEntity {
    @Field()
    title: string;
    @Field()
    completed: boolean;
}
```

*src/app/app.component.ts*
```ts{2-3,12-30}
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Context } from '@remult/core';
import { Task } from './tasks';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'remult-angular-todo';
  constructor(public context: Context) {
  }
  newTask = this.context.for(Task).create();
  async createNewTask() {
    await this.newTask.save();
    this.newTask = this.context.for(Task).create();
    this.loadTasks();
  }
  tasks: Task[];
  async loadTasks() {
    this.tasks = await this.context.for(Task).find();
  }
  ngOnInit() {
    this.loadTasks();
  }
  async deleteTask(task: Task) {
    await task.delete();
    this.loadTasks();
  }
}
```

*src/app/app.component.html*
```html
<title>{{title}}</title>
<div>
  <input [(ngModel)]="newTask.title" placeholder="Title">
  <button (click)="createNewTask()">Create new task</button>
</div>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
    <input [(ngModel)]="task.completed" type="checkbox">
    <input [(ngModel)]="task.title" 
       [style.textDecoration]="task.completed?'line-through':''">
    <button (click)="task.save()" [disabled]="!task.wasChanged()">Save</button>
    <button (click)="deleteTask(task)">Delete</button>
 </li>
</ul>
```

## Sorting and Filtering
The RESTful API create by Remult supports server-side sorting and filtering. Let's use that sort and filter the list of tasks.

### Show uncompleted tasks first
Uncompleted tasks are important and should appear above completed tasks in the todo app. 

In the `loadTasks` method of the `AppComponent` class, modify the `find` method call to include an `options` argument which implements the `FindOptions` interface. Implement the interface using an anonymous object and set the object's `orderBy` property to an arrow function which accepts an argument of the `Task` entity class and returns its `completed` field.

*src/app/app.component.ts*
```ts{2-4}
async loadTasks() {
  this.tasks = await this.context.for(Task).find({
    orderBy: task => task.completed
  });
}
```

By default, `false` is a "lower" value than `true`, and that's why uncompleted tasks are now showing at the top of the task list.

### Optionally hide completed tasks
Let's add the option to toggle the display of completed tasks using a checkbox at the top of the task list.

1. Add a `hideCompleted` boolean field to the `AppComponent` class.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   hideCompleted: boolean;
   ```

2. In the `loadTasks` method of the `AppComponent` class, set the `where` property of the `options` argument of `find` to an arrow function which accepts an argument of the `Task` entity class and returns an `isEqualTo(false)` filter if the `hideCompleted` field is `true`.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts{3}
   async loadTasks() {
     this.tasks = await this.context.for(Task).find({
       where: task => this.hideCompleted ? task.completed.isEqualTo(false) : undefined,
       orderBy: task => task.completed
     });
   }
   ```

   ::: warning Note
   Because the `completed` field is of type `BoolColumn`, the argument of its `isEqualTo` method is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type.**
   :::

3. Add a `checkbox` input element immediately before the unordered list element in `app.component.html`, bind it to the `hideCompleted` field, and add a `change` handler which calls `loadTasks` when the value of the checkbox is changed.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html
   <p>
      <input type="checkbox" id="hideCompleted" [(ngModel)]="hideCompleted" (change)="loadTasks()">
      <label for="hideCompleted">Hide completed</label>
   </p>
   ```

After the browser refreshes, a "Hide completed" checkbox appears above the task list. The user can toggle the display of uncompleted tasks using the checkbox.

## Validation
Validating user entered data is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

### Validate task title length

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule, and display an appropriate error message in the UI.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Field` decorator for the `title` field to include an argument which implements the `ColumnOptions` interface. Implement the interface using an anonymous object and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

   *src/app/task.ts*
   ```ts{1-3}
    @Field({
        validate: Validators.required
    })
    title: string;
   ```

2. In the `app.component.html` template, add a `div` element immediately after the `div` element containing the new task title `input`. Set an `ngIf` directive to display the new `div` only if `newTask.$.title.error` is not `undefined` and place the `error` text as its contents.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html
   <div *ngIf="newTask.$.title.error">
      {{newTask.$.title.error}}
   </div>
   ```

After the browser refreshes, try creating a new `task` without title - the "Should not be empty" error message is displayed.

Attempting to modify titles of existing tasks to invalid values will also fail, but the error message is not displayed because we haven't added the template element to display it.

### Implicit server-side validation
The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:4200/api/tasks` API route, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:4200/api/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\": \"\"}"
```

An http error is returned and the validation error text is included in the response body,


## Backend methods
When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

### Set all tasks as un/completed
Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAll` async function to the `AppComponent` class, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   async setAll(completed: boolean) {
     for await (const task of this.context.for(Task).iterate()) {
        task.completed = completed;
        await task.save();
     }
     this.loadTasks();
   }
   ```

   The `iterate` method is an alternative form of fetching data from the API server, which is intended for operating on large numbers of entity objects. The `iterate` method doesn't return an array (as the `find` method) and instead returns an `iteratable` object which supports iterations using the JavaScript `for await` statement.


2. Add the two buttons to the `app.component.html` template, immediately before the unordered list element. Both of the buttons' `click` events will call the `setAll` function with the relevant value of the `completed` argument.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html
   <button (click)="setAll(true)">Set all as completed</button> 
   <button (click)="setAll(false)">Set all as uncompleted</button>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.
### Refactoring `setAll` to have it run on the server
With the current state of the `setAll` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAll` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

Refactor the `for await` loop from the `setAll` function of the `AppComponent` class into a new, `static`, `setAll` function which will run on the server.

*src/app/app.component.ts*
```ts{2,5-11}
async setAll(completed: boolean) {
   await AppComponent.setAll(completed);
   this.loadTasks();
}
@BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
static async setAll(completed: boolean, context?: Context) {
   for await (const task of context.for(Task).iterate()) {
      task.completed = completed;
      await task.save();
   }
}
```

::: danger Import BackendMethod
Don't forget to import `BackendMethod` from `@remult/core` for this code to work.
:::

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial). 

The optional `context` argument of the static `setAll` function is omitted in the client-side calling code, and injected by Remult on the server-side with a server `Context` object. **Unlike the client implementation of the Remult `Context`, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

::: warning Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:
:::

After the browser refreshed, the "Set all..." buttons function exactly the same, but they will do the work much faster.

## Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism which enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

User authentication remains outside the scope of Remult. In this tutorial, we'll use a [JWT Bearer token](https://jwt.io) authentication. JSON web tokens will be issued by the API server upon a successful simplistic sign in (based on username without password) and sent in all subsequent API requests using an [Authorization HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).

### Tasks CRUD operations require sign in
This rule is implemented within the `Task` entity class constructor, by modifying the `allowApiCrud` property of the anonymous implementation of the argument sent to the `@Entity` decorator, from a `true` value to an arrow function which accepts a Remult `Context` object and returns the result of the context's `isSignedIn` method.

*src/app/task.ts*
```ts{3}
@Entity({
    key: "tasks",
    allowApiCrud: context => context.isSignedIn()
})
```

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks disappeared and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: danger Authorized server-side code can still modify tasks
Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAll` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAll` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAll` method of `AppComponent`.

*src/app/app.component.ts*
```ts
@BackendMethod({ allowed: context => context.isSignedIn() })
```
:::
### User authentication
Let's add a sign in area to the todo app, with an `input` for typing in a `username` and a sign in `button`. The app will have two valid `username` values - *"Jane"* and *"Steve"*. After a successful sign in, the sign in area will be replaced by a "Hi [username]" message.

In this section, we'll be using the following packages:
* [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) to create JSON web tokens
* [@auth0/angular-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt) for client-side JWT decoding and passing HTTP `Authorization` headers to the API server
* [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt) to read HTTP `Authorization` headers and validate JWT on the API server

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```sh
   npm i jsonwebtoken @auth0/angular-jwt express-jwt
   ```

2. Import `jsonwebtoken` into a `jwt` variable in `app.component.ts`.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   import * as jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
   ```

3. Exclude `jsonwebtoken` from browser builds by adding the following JSON to the main section of the project's `package.json` file.

   *package.json*
   ```json
   "browser": {
      "jsonwebtoken": false
   }
   ```

   ::: danger This step is not optional
   Angular CLI will fail to serve/build the app unless `jsonwebtoken` is excluded.

   **For this change to take effect, our Angular app's dev server must be restarted by terminating the `dev-ng` script and running it again.**
   :::

4. Add a `signIn` backend method to the `AppComponent` class. The (very) simplistic `signIn` function will accept a `username` argument, define a dictionary of valid users, check whether the argument value exists in the dictionary and return a JWT string signed with a secret key. 
   
   The payload of the JWT must contain an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface, which consists of a string `id`, a string `name` and an array of string `roles`.

   ```ts
   @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
   static async signIn(username: string) {
      let validUsers = [
          { id: "1", name: "Jane", roles: [] },
         { id: "2", name: "Steve", roles: [] }
      ];
      let user = validUsers.find(user => user.name === username);
      if (!user)
         throw "Invalid User";
      return jwt.sign(user, "my secret key");
   }
   ```

   ::: warning Note
   The secret key used to sign the JWT should be kept secret (dah) 

5. Modify the main server module `index.ts` to use the `express-jwt` authentication Express middleware. Then, provide the `UserInfo` JWT payload (stored by `express-jwt` in `req.user`) to Remult.

   *src/server/index.ts*
   ```ts{4,7-13}
   import * as express from 'express';
   import { initExpress } from '@remult/core/server';
   import '../app/app.module';
   import * as expressJwt from 'express-jwt';

   let app = express();
   app.use(expressJwt({ 
      secret: "my secret key", 
      credentialsRequired: false, 
      algorithms: ['HS256'] }));
   initExpress(app);
   app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
   ```

   The `secret` provided to `express-jwt` must be identical to the one used by `jsonwebtoken` to sign the JWT in the `signIn` server function.

   `credentialsRequired` is set to `false` to allow unauthenticated API requests (e.g. the request to `signIn`).

   The `algorithms` property must contain the algorithm used to sign the JWT (`HS256` is the default algorithm used by `jsonwebtoken`).

6. Add the following code to the `AppComponent` class.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   static readonly AUTH_TOKEN_KEY = "authToken";

   setAuthToken(token: string) {
      this.context.setUser(<UserInfo>new JwtHelperService().decodeToken(token));
      sessionStorage.setItem(AppComponent.AUTH_TOKEN_KEY, token);
   }

   username: string;

   async signIn() {
      this.setAuthToken(await AppComponent.signIn(this.username));
      this.loadTasks();
   }

   signOut() {
      this.context.setUser(undefined);
      sessionStorage.removeItem(AppComponent.AUTH_TOKEN_KEY);
      this.tasks = [];
   }
   ```

   ::: warning Imports
   This code requires imports for `UserInfo` from `@remult/core` and `JwtHelperService` from `@auth0/angular-jwt`.
   :::

7. Add the following `HTML` after the `title` element of the `app.component.html` template.

   *src/app/app.component.html*
   ```html
   <p>
      <ng-container *ngIf="!context.isSignedIn()">
         <input [(ngModel)]="username"> 
         <button (click)="signIn()">Sign in</button>
      </ng-container>

      <ng-container *ngIf="context.isSignedIn()">
         Hi {{context.user.name}}
         <button (click)="signOut()">Sign out</button>
      </ng-container>
   </p>
   ```

8. Add `JwtModule` to the `imports` section of the `@NgModule` decorator of the `AppModule` class.

   *src/app/app.module.ts*
   ```ts
   JwtModule.forRoot({
      config:{
         tokenGetter: () => sessionStorage.getItem(AppComponent.AUTH_TOKEN_KEY)
      }
   })
   ```

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with all access restricted to signed in users only.

As there is no point in displaying anything but the sign in area to users who haven't signed in yet, we can move the rest of the template elements into the second `ng-container`, conditioned by `*ngIf="context.isSignedIn()"`.

### Role-based authorization
Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. Let's define an `admin` role for our todo list, and enforce the following authorization rules:

* All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
* All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
* Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.
* Only users belonging to the `admin` role can mark all tasks as completed or uncompleted.

1. Create a `roles.ts` file in the `src/app/` folder, with the following `Roles` class definition:

   *src/app/roles.ts*
   ```ts
   export const Roles = {
      admin: 'admin'
   }
   ```

2. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to reflect the top three authorization rules.

   *src/app/task.ts*
   ```ts{2,6-9,14}
   import { Field, Entity, IdEntity, Validators } from "@remult/core";
   import { Roles } from "./roles";

   @Entity({
      key: "tasks",
      allowApiRead: context => context.isSignedIn(),
      allowApiUpdate: context => context.isSignedIn(),
      allowApiInsert: Roles.admin,
      allowApiDelete: Roles.admin
   })
   export class Task extends IdEntity {
      @Field({
         validate: Validators.required,
         allowApiUpdate: Roles.admin
      })
      title: string;
      @Field()
      completed: boolean;
   }
   ```

3. Modify the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the AppComponent's `setAll` server function, to reflect the required `admin` role.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts
   @BackendMethod({ allowed: Roles.admin })
   ```

4. Let's have the *"Jane"* belong to the `admin` role by modifying the `roles` array of her `validUsers` entry in the `signIn` server function.

   *src/app/app.component.ts*
   ```ts{4}
   @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
   static async signIn(username: string) {
      let validUsers = [
      { id: "1", name: "Jane", roles: [ Roles.admin] },
      { id: "2", name: "Steve", roles: [] }
      ];
      let user = validUsers.find(user => user.name === username);
      if (!user)
      throw "Invalid User";
      return jwt.sign(user, "my secret key");
   }
   ```


**Sign in to the app as *"Steve"* to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

::: tip Bonus - store the user who completed the task

Now that our todo app requires a valid, signed in, user, we can easily add a `completedUser` field to the `Task` entity class and store the name of the authenticated user who completed each task.

1. Add a `completedUser` field (of type `string`) to the `Task` entity class, and define it with `allowApiUpdate: false` to ensure it is only updated by server-side code.

   *src/app/task.ts*
   ```ts
   @Field({
      allowApiUpdate: false
   })
   completedUser: string;
   ```

2. Add a `context` argument to the constructor of the `Task` entity class, and set the `saving` property of the `EntitySettings` implemented in the constructor to the following arrow function.

   *src/app/task.ts*
   ```ts{1,7-11,14-16}
   @Entity<Task>({
      key: "tasks",
      allowApiRead: context => context.isSignedIn(),
      allowApiUpdate: context => context.isSignedIn(),
      allowApiInsert: Roles.admin,
      allowApiDelete: Roles.admin,
      saving: task => {
         if (task.context.backend && task.completed && task.$.completed.wasChanged())
               task.completedUser = task.context.user.name;
      }
   })
   export class Task extends IdEntity {
      constructor(private context: Context) {
         super();
      }
      ...
   ```

The `context` constructor argument will be injected with either a client-side `Context` implementation or a server-side one, depending on the runtime context of the code.

When the `save` method of a `Task` object is called in client-side code, the `saving` function is executed twice. First, it runs in the browser, before the an API `put` request is submitted. Next, when the API request is handled on the API server, the `saving` function is invoked again before the database is updated. The `Context.onServer` property is used here to ensure our code runs only once, on the server-side.

## Deployment

In this tutorial, we'll deploy both the Angular app files and the API server project to the same host, and redirect all non-API requests to return the Angular app's `index.html` page.

In addition, to follow a few basic production best practices, we'll use [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) middleware to improve performance and [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) middleware to improve security.

1. Install `compression` and `helmet`.

   ```sh
   npm i compression helmet
   ```

2. Add the highlighted code lines to `src/server/index.ts`, and modify the `app.listen` function's `port` argument to prefer a port number provided by the production host's `PORT` environment variable.

   *src/server/index.ts*
   ```ts{5-6,9-10,19-21}
   import * as express from 'express';
   import { initExpress } from '@remult/core/server';
   import '../app/app.module';
   import * as expressJwt from 'express-jwt';
   import * as compression from 'compression';
   import * as helmet from 'helmet';

   let app = express();
   app.use(helmet());
   app.use(compression());
   app.use(expressJwt({
      secret: "my secret key",
      credentialsRequired: false,
      algorithms: ['HS256']
   }));
   initExpress(app);
   app.use(express.static('dist/remult-angular-todo'));
   app.use('/*', async (req, res) => {
      res.sendFile('./dist/remult-angular-todo/index.html');
   });
   app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
   ```

3. Modify the project's `build` npm script to also transpile the API server's TypeScript code to JavaScript (using `tsc`).

   *package.json*
   ```json
   "build": "ng build && tsc -p tsconfig.server.json"
   ```

4. Modify the project's `start` npm script to start the production Node server.

   *package.json*
   ```json
   "start": "node dist/server/server/"
   ```

The todo app is now ready for deployment to production.

#### Deploy to heroku

In order to deploy the todo app to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) you'll need a `heroku` account. You'll also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) installed.

1. In the root folder, initialize Git and commit your work:

   ```sh
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "todo app tutorial"
   ```

2. Create a Heroku `app`:

   ```sh
   heroku create
   ```

3. Deploy to Heroku using `git push`:

   ```sh
   git push heroku master
   ```

4. Run the production app using `heroku apps:open` command: 

   ```sh
   heroku apps:open
   ```

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Heroku, try using Heroku's [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).
:::

#### Use PostreSQL as production database

While the simple backend JSON database provided by `remult` is nice for development, it isn't suitable for production (it will be discarded each time the Heroku `dyno` is restarted).

Let's replace it with a production PostgreSQL database.

1. Install `pg` and `@remult/server-postgres`.

   ```sh
   npm i pg @remult/server-postgres
   ```

2. Add the highlighted code lines to `src/server/index.ts`.

   *src/server/index.ts*
   ```ts{7-9,18-25,28}
   import * as express from 'express';
   import { initExpress } from '@remult/core/server';
   import '../app/app.module';
   import * as expressJwt from 'express-jwt';
   import * as compression from 'compression';
   import * as helmet from 'helmet';
   import { SqlDatabase } from '@remult/core';
   import { PostgresDataProvider, verifyStructureOfAllEntities } from '@remult/server-postgres';
   import { Pool } from 'pg';

   let app = express();
   app.use(helmet());
   app.use(compression());
   app.use(expressJwt({ 
      secret: "my secret key", 
      credentialsRequired: false, 
      algorithms: ['HS256'] }));
   let getDatabase = () => {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
         const db = new SqlDatabase(new PostgresDataProvider(new Pool()));
         verifyStructureOfAllEntities(db);
         return db;
      }
      return undefined;
   }
   initExpress(app, {
      getUserFromRequest: req => req.user,
      dataProvider: getDatabase()
   });
   app.use(express.static('dist/remult-angular-todo'));
   app.use('/*', async (req, res) => {
      res.sendFile('./dist/remult-angular-todo/index.html');
   });
   app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
   ```

3. Deploy to Heroku using `git push`:

   ```sh
   git push heroku master
   ```

4. Run the production app using `heroku apps:open` command: 

   ```sh
   heroku apps:open
   ```

## todo
[V] finish release of remult after jwt changes introduced in v2.2.1

[V] don't forget to add .env to the .gitignore

[V] Reconsider the Context Injection to use angular http client instead of nothing is it does right now. maybe even consider creating an AppContext and do something with it~~

[V] extract from init express the usage of compression, secure etc... and make the JwtAuthentication recieve a authenticate provider interface that is simple and is implemented with the jwt. make JWTCookieAuthorizationHelper internal and only get sign and validate in the interface.

[] reconsider the find limit - currently it's set by default to 25 and that can cause problems.

[] reconsider separating the setup code - to something the user can extract from a github template - and only worry about the setup if they want to.

[] document the constructor parameters of field

[] verifyStructureOfAllEntities better name (should include the word schema)

[] consider more code reviews

[] code sections prevent scrollbar

[] "set all..." buttons hidden for Steve

[] reflect-metadata should be a dependency of remult core

[] setAuthToken from ngOnInit()

[] add dotenv before secret key

[] upgrade vuepress for code groups

[] check ng new strict 

[] check angular cli versions / node versions
