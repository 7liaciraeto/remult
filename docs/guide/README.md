# Introduction 

Remult is an end to end library that handles both server and browser concerns. It was designed so that you can have a single code base that will run both in the browser and on the server, using the same classes and same writing style. IT's fully typed and allows for type checks even when you call the server.

We've written this basic guide that is designed for anyone with basic development skills - no angular background required.
